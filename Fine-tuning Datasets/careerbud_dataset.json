Typically, it's best to use action verbs and data-backed words rather than 'fluff.' For example, if you're outlining social media marketing experience, rather than simply stating 'I managed social media platforms for my client,' write 'Increased social media lead generation by X percent year-over-year.' This cuts to the point and backs up your credentials with hard data to showcase your success."

'A great software engineer resume will demonstrate quantifiable success in areas like designing and delivering cloud solutions [or] using the latest technologies and development methodologies in DevOps, or [they'll show their] experience with microservices, Lean, Agile, Serverless, containerization, and cloud platforms,' Davis says."

        "response": "Describing your experience using specific details (like the type of project, the technologies used, or the type of client) and outcomes (like a completed website design, successful application launch, or a % decrease in code churn) will help to bring your resume to life and help recruiters better understand how your experience fits into the opening they're looking to fill. 'Make it a priority to provide context and highlight not just what your skills are, but when and how you applied them,' Inamdar explains."

        "response": "'If you know Scrum, when did you use it? If you're an expert in Python, at which job did you use that language?' So instead of writing a bland bullet point like 'responsible for delivering end-to-end solutions using cloud-native platforms,' you could craft something much more compelling, like 'leveraged architectural expertise in Kubernetes cloud-native platform to deliver mature end-to-end solutions for 20 unique internal applications teams.' Notice how the second example includes details about the platform this candidate uses (Kubernetes), who they're developing solutions for (internal applications teams), and the scope of their responsibilities (20 separate teams). Incorporating key details, technologies, or quantifiable metrics wherever possible will help your resume stand out."

    },
    {
        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",
        "response": "Recruiters tend to favor chronological resumes because they're straightforward and easy to follow. Similarly, avoid design elements that will make your resume hard to scan-either by a computer or by a person."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you suggest changes on me Resume?",
        "response": "'Too much formatting makes your resume less searchable,' Inamdar says. For example, some ATSs have issues parsing columns and will read them straight across."

        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",
        "response": "Meanwhile, an overly flashy design may make it hard for even a human to quickly pick out the information they want from your resume. Dividing your resume into clear sections (like education, experience, and technical skills) will also make a recruiter's job easier."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my CV?",
        "response": "'Keep the formatting as simple as possible and avoid using fonts that are hard to read,' Inamdar says. 'The focus should be on your work history and your skills.'

        "input": "How can I improve my CV?",
        "response": "If you don't have much (or any) direct professional experience to speak of, your education, training, and technical skills will be especially important. So you'll want to be sure that it stands out."
    },

        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",

        "response": "Weigh Your Layout Options. Finally, if you're making a career pivot, you might want to consider an alternative layout (maybe a combination or functional resume), as these formats take the focus off of your chronological work experience while giving you the flexibility to feature your most relevant experience most prominently."

    {
        "input": "How can I improve my CV?",
