For example, you may have a job description that reads: 'During my time at Freedom Inc., I ran multiple team-based projects and helped each team member with various tasks associated with each project.' You can shorten and strengthen this example in the following way: 'Led 10 team-based projects, including the implementation of a new point-of-service system, and helped five team members meet project requirements and deadlines with 95% accuracy.'

'The top third of your resume is prime resume real estate,' added Lisa Rangel, an executive resume writer and CEO of Chameleon Resumes. 'Create a robust summary to capture the hiring manager's eye.'

Enelow and Kursmark call this your 'wow factor' - a quick hit of information that highlights your achievements and that shows up prominently throughout your resume."

Ditch the Objective (and replace it with a Summary). 'When you include an Objective, you're telling employers what you want from them and, frankly, they don't care,' write Enelow and Kursmark."

        "input": "I want ways to enhance my CV",
        "response": "That's why the Summary section - a short professional synopsis that highlights your years of experience, job history and major achievements - has largely replaced the Objective in modern resumes. The one time when an Objective might still be in order, they say, is when your Objective might not be clear from your work experience."

    {
        "input": "Could you suggest changes on me Resume?",

        "response": "Stand out with ATS-friendly design elements. Really want your resume to stand out from the sea of Times New Roman? Yes, creative resumes-like infographics, videos, or presentations can set you apart, but you have to make sure they actually get read."
    },
    {
        "input": "I need help with my Resume",

    },
    {

Design your resume for skimmability."

    {
        "input": "I want ways to enhance my CV",

    },
    {
        "input": "I want you to help me update my CV",

        "input": "Could you suggest changes on me Resume?",

        "input": "How can I improve my Resume?",
        "response": "So start with a strong action verb, include relevant skills from the job description, and frame your bullets around your achievements-don't just list your job duties. Tell them how your work benefitted your boss or company so they know what they stand to gain by hiring you."
    },

        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my Resume?",
        "response": " But don't only put your skills in your skills section. Your skills section is an easy way for anyone reading your resume to confirm that you have required skills, but that shouldn't be the only place that your important skills appear."

    },
    {
        "input": "I want you to help me update my Resume",
        "response": "If you didn't focus on professional development, that's fine too! But not every employer will appreciate it if you get too cutesy about that section of your resume. For example, if you took time out of the workforce to raise kids, you might not want to describe this parenting experience on your resume,  la 'adeptly managed the growing pile of laundry.' Instead state what you did plainly and include any professional skills you may have grown or activities you may have done."
    },
    {
        "input": "Give me some CV tips",
        "response": "Ditch 'References available upon request' If a hiring manager is interested in you, they'll ask you for references-and will assume that you have them. There's no need to address the obvious (and doing so might even make you look a little out of touch!)."

    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my Resume?",
        "response": "Unless a job posting specifically requests that you do otherwise, your resume should always be submitted as either a PDF or Word document (.docx not .doc). These are the formats that can be most easily opened and most easily parsed by an ATS."
    },
    {
        "input": "I want ways to enhance my Resume",
        "response": "The choice between the two is up to you though-again unless the company you're applying to requests one format over the other. If you're emailing your resume, however, PDFs are a bit more likely to maintain your formatting across different computers and programs."
    },
    {
        "input": "Give me some CV tips",
        "response": "Name your file clearly. Ready to save your resume and send it off? Save it as 'Jane Smith Resume' instead of 'Resume.' The hiring manager is going to have plenty of 'Resume's on their computer, so make it super easy for them to find what they're looking for."
    },
    {
        "input": "I need help with my Resume",
        "response": "You can even go a bit further and put the position title in your file name (e.g., 'Jane Smith Marketing Analyst Resume).  Keep your resume outline fresh."

    },
    {
        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",
        "response": "These programs scan each resume submitted for a job posting in search of relevant keywords to determine whether a candidate's skills are a match for the job. If your resume is devoid of relevant terms, the ATS will probably reject your application-even if you have the right experience."
    },
    {
        "input": "I need help with my CV",
        "response": "So for starters, you'll want to incorporate as many job-specific and industry-specific keywords as possible, notes Muse career coach Steven Davis, owner of Renaissance Solutions Inc., a coaching and recruiting agency specializing in software engineering, product manager, and project manager opportunities. Beyond that, 'Try to tailor your resume to the specific job posting where possible,' Inamdar says."

    {
        "input": "How can I improve my Resume?",
        "response": "'Hiring managers will compare the narrative of your resume to their role to determine whether your experience is compatible.' Think: What does the recruiter or hiring manager need to know about your experience in order to understand that you're qualified? So as you read through a job description, take note of the skills, responsibilities, languages, and programs mentioned and remember: If you have experience with anything listed, it belongs on your resume. On the flip side, try to avoid including skills or experiences that don't apply."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my Resume?",
        "response": "'Utilizing words or descriptions that don't match job requirements' is one of the biggest mistakes software engineers make when drafting their resumes, according to Davis. Relevant keywords will vary from one specialty, company, or job posting to the next, but here are a few to get you started, depending on your area of expertise: Front-End Development Keywords: APIs, Back-End Data Display, Coding, Collaborate with Back-End Developers, Collaborate with Web Designers, Create Web Pages, CSS, Current Web Trends, Dynamic Web Page Design, Framework Templates, HTML, JavaScript, Search Engine Optimization, Software Workflow, Styling and Color Design, User Interface, UX (User Experience), Website Content Display, Website Navigation Optimization."

Feature Your Technical Know-How."
    },
    {
        "input": "I need help with my CV",
        "response": "Software engineers rely on specific programs, systems, and languages to perform their jobs, so recruiters will be especially interested in the technical skills section of your resume. That means it's well worth investing some serious time and effort into creating a detailed technical skills section."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my Resume?",
        "response": "'When I'm reviewing a candidate's resume, I want to see how the technologies they've listed align with what we use. Does their technical experience mesh well with where we are as a company?' Inamdar says."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my CV?",
        "response": "Breaking this portion of your resume down into more specific subsections will make it easier for recruiters and hiring managers to spot the specific skills they're looking for (check out the example resume below to see this in action), so before you sit down to write your resume, make a list of the specific systems, methodologies, and platforms you've worked with, and note your corresponding level of expertise in each (e.g. are you fluent in JavaScript? Familiar with AngularJS? An expert in Python?)."
    },
    {
        "input": "I need help with my CV",
        "response": "Bonus points if you've attended a training course or earned a certification! Need a few examples? Davis has you covered. 'Front-end developers should include frameworks such as Angular or React, back-end developers need to highlight their knowledge of the inner workings of web applications and server-side buildouts, and full-stack engineers should mention their use of Node.js or Serverless.' Davis also has a reminder for full-stack engineers: 'It's imperative to include experience with both front-end and back-end development.' Again, tailoring your resume for each job description is crucial-especially as you're drafting your technical skills section."

    {
        "input": "Could you suggest changes on me Resume?",
        "response": "Be Specific About Your Accomplishments. 'A great software engineer resume will demonstrate quantifiable success in areas like designing and delivering cloud solutions [or] using the latest technologies and development methodologies in DevOps, or [they'll show their] experience with microservices, Lean, Agile, Serverless, containerization, and cloud platforms,' Davis says."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my CV?",
        "response": "Describing your experience using specific details (like the type of project, the technologies used, or the type of client) and outcomes (like a completed website design, successful application launch, or a % decrease in code churn) will help to bring your resume to life and help recruiters better understand how your experience fits into the opening they're looking to fill. 'Make it a priority to provide context and highlight not just what your skills are, but when and how you applied them,' Inamdar explains."
    },
    {
        "input": "How can I improve my CV?",
        "response": "'If you know Scrum, when did you use it? If you're an expert in Python, at which job did you use that language?' So instead of writing a bland bullet point like 'responsible for delivering end-to-end solutions using cloud-native platforms,' you could craft something much more compelling, like 'leveraged architectural expertise in Kubernetes cloud-native platform to deliver mature end-to-end solutions for 20 unique internal applications teams.' Notice how the second example includes details about the platform this candidate uses (Kubernetes), who they're developing solutions for (internal applications teams), and the scope of their responsibilities (20 separate teams). Incorporating key details, technologies, or quantifiable metrics wherever possible will help your resume stand out."

    {
        "input": "I want ways to enhance my CV",
        "response": "They should quickly be able to understand what you're looking for and what your experience is,' Inamdar advises. So unless you're making a major career pivot (more on that below), a traditional chronological layout is probably the way to go."
    },
    {
        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",
        "response": "Recruiters tend to favor chronological resumes because they're straightforward and easy to follow. Similarly, avoid design elements that will make your resume hard to scan-either by a computer or by a person."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you suggest changes on me Resume?",
        "response": "'Too much formatting makes your resume less searchable,' Inamdar says. For example, some ATSs have issues parsing columns and will read them straight across."
    },
    {
        "input": "Can you give me some tips to improve my CV?",
        "response": "Meanwhile, an overly flashy design may make it hard for even a human to quickly pick out the information they want from your resume. Dividing your resume into clear sections (like education, experience, and technical skills) will also make a recruiter's job easier."
    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my CV?",
        "response": "'Keep the formatting as simple as possible and avoid using fonts that are hard to read,' Inamdar says. 'The focus should be on your work history and your skills.' If you're feeling nervous about getting past the ATS but want to show off your design chops, consider creating an online portfolio that you can link out to from your resume."

    },
    {
        "input": "Could you improve my Resume?",
        "response": "So unless you have decades of experience, a single-page resume should suffice. Streamlining the content of your resume to reflect the job posting you're applying to and keeping the focus on your most recent experience should help you to keep your word count down."
    },
    {

        "response": "If you've never technically worked as a software engineer, but recently earned a computer science degree or completed a robust training program (like a coding bootcamp), you can still create a stellar resume. You'll just need to make a few minor tweaks to the traditional format."
    },

        "response": "Weigh Your Layout Options. Finally, if you're making a career pivot, you might want to consider an alternative layout (maybe a combination or functional resume), as these formats take the focus off of your chronological work experience while giving you the flexibility to feature your most relevant experience most prominently."
