For example, you may have a job description that reads: 'During my time at Freedom Inc., I ran multiple team-based projects and helped each team member with various tasks associated with each project.' You can shorten and strengthen this example in the following way: 'Led 10 team-based projects, including the implementation of a new point-of-service system, and helped five team members meet project requirements and deadlines with 95% accuracy.'
